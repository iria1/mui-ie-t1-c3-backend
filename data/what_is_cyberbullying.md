# What Is Cyberbullying?

Cyberbullying is when someone uses the internet, phone, or social media to hurt, threaten, or embarrass another person. It can happen in many ways, like:

- Sending mean or hurtful messages
- Spreading lies or rumors online
- Posting embarrassing pictures or videos
- Making fake accounts to mock someone
- Excluding people from online groups

Cyberbullying can happen any time — even when you're at home. Unlike bullying at school, it doesn't stop after class ends.

It can make people feel scared, sad, angry, or alone. No one deserves to be treated that way, and it’s important to speak up if you or someone you know is being bullied.
