# What Is Cyberbullying?

Cyberbullying is bullying that happens through digital devices like phones, computers, or tablets. It can occur on social media, messaging apps, online games, forums, or any space where people can post, share, or message.

It involves repeated behavior meant to scare, anger, shame, or hurt someone, and can happen anytime — even at home. Unlike face-to-face bullying, it often leaves a **digital footprint** that can be used as evidence.

**Examples include:**
- Sending hurtful messages or threats  
- Spreading lies, rumors, or embarrassing photos/videos  
- Pretending to be someone else to post or send harmful content  
- Sharing private or personal information without consent  
- Mocking someone because of personal traits (race, religion, gender, appearance, etc.)  
- Excluding someone from online groups on purpose

**Why it’s harmful:**
- It can reach a large audience quickly  
- Content can be permanent if not removed  
- It can damage reputations and mental health  
- It’s harder for parents or teachers to notice  

A joke becomes bullying if it’s hurtful, unwanted, and doesn’t stop after you ask. Everyone deserves respect — online and offline.
