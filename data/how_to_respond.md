## If you’re being cyberbullied:
- Tell a trusted adult (parent, teacher, counselor). Pick a good time, explain clearly, and help them understand the situation. You don’t have to face it alone.
- Don’t retaliate — responding can make things worse.
- Walk away — log off, take a break, and do something you enjoy.
- Keep evidence — save posts, messages, or screenshots in case you need to report.
- Report it — use in-app tools on social media, games, or messaging platforms. Reporting is often anonymous.
- Block or restrict the bully to stop contact.
- Contact authorities if there are threats, stalking, or sexual content involving a minor.

## If your friend is being cyberbullied:
- Listen and support — ask how they feel and what they want to do.
- Encourage talking to an adult — offer to go with them.
- Help report — you can often report on their behalf (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter allow this).
- Be an upstander — send kind messages, publicly show support, or calmly call out bullying if safe.
- Respect their pace — if they’re not ready to report, stay by their side and check in often.

## Staying safe online:
- Think before posting — what you share can last forever.
- Avoid sharing personal details (address, phone, school).
- Learn and use privacy settings on apps.
- Use tools to limit, hide, or delete unwanted interactions.
