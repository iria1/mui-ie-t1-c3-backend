# How To Help a Friend Who's Being Cyberbullied

If you think your friend is being bullied online, here are some ways you can help:

- **Check in** with them — a simple “Are you okay?” can mean a lot.
- **Listen** without judging or trying to fix everything.
- **Encourage them** to talk to a trusted adult.
- **Stand up for them** in a safe way (but don’t fight back).
- **Report** the bullying if you see it.

Being there for someone can make a big difference. Sometimes, just knowing someone cares helps people feel less alone.
